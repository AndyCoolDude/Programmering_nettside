				Most people are being monitored and controlled by what they see
				on social media
			</div>

				Social media like facebook or tiktok are designed for us to
				spend as much time as possible on the websites.

				I am personally interested in gaming, and this means that i will
				see something completely different than someone who is

				Since we have clicked on different reccomended videos and
				pictures, we see different things because the algorithm knows
				what we want. When we see what we want to see, we can sometimes
				block out everything we disagree with. This can make us believe
				certain things.

				If i only see articles about the world being flat and covid-19
				being a hoax, it will be hard for me to believe otherwise.

				Big tech companies can sell our information and use it to learn
				how to best profit from us.
