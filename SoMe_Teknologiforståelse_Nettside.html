				Social media like facebook or tiktok are designed for us to
				spend as much time as possible on the websites.
			</div>
			<div>
				Social media have built in algorithms to determine what people want to see.
				Since i click on and search for gaming related content, I will see more things reccomended to me that are gaming related.
			</div>
			<div>
				Since you and me have clicked on different reccomended videos and
				pictures, we see different things because the algorithm knows
				what we want. When we see what we want to see, we can sometimes
				block out everything we disagree with.
				We go deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole, until we no longer recognize the truth.
				</thead>
			</div>
			<div>
				The algorithm can show us what we want to see, but cannot determine whether or not what we get reccomended is real or fake news.
				In 2016 a conspiracy theory known as Pizzagate caused a 28 year old man to be arrested after he fired gunshots inside a restaurant.
				He had read online about a illegal operation happening inside a pizzeria named Comet, and decided to take the law in his own hands.
				This shows why fake news are so important to nip in the bud before they grow too large.
			</div>
			<div>
				The reason fake news and conspiracy theories can spread so fast, is because of clickbait.
				Clickbait is when an article is named something like "Top 10 proofs the earth is flat," a title meant for you to be amazed.
				It tricks you into clicking on it. By you clicking on it it reccomends it to other people, leading to a mass of people finding the article.
				Some more trusting than others.
			</div>
			<div>
				People over 65 share 7 times more fake news than other age demographics according to NYU and Princeton.
				I believe this is because they are more trusting than other people.
				When they were young they had editors fact checking the newspapers they wrote, leading to more accurate sources.
				A lot of the older folk believe this is still the case, that information on the internet is always true and is fact checked.
				Allthough the truth is, it is not.
